# shades-of-beauty-backend
This is a backend application for a Client of mine, Shades of Beauty. 

I was originally going to use stripe as my backend system for this particular
client. However, the application began to grow more complex requiring her own clients to be able to schedule appointments
dynamically. 

I decided to move forward and use Django as the backend for her website.

This application allowed me to gain experience in wrapping REST API's with GraphQL running on an express server, which I was
extremely pleased with and will continue to use GraphQL for all of my future projects.
